// 1)  Data model
//     MongoDB stores data in JSON documents, then organizes them into collections.

//     MySQL stores data in columns and rows. Data storage is tabular and relational.

// 2) Query language
//    MongoDB uses MongoDB Query Language. 

//    MySQL uses SQL.

// 3) Flexibility
// MongoDB does not have a schema, providing more flexibility and 
// allowing it to work with unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data.

// MySQL has a rigid schema that works well with structured data.

// 4) Type
// MongoDB stores data as JSON documents in a more flexible format. 
// Both offer performance and scalability, but they give better performance for 
// different use cases.

// MySQL is a relational database system that stores data in a structured tabular format. 

// 5) When to use
// MongoDB is a NoSQL database. It’s more appropriate when you work with unstructured 
// data in use cases like social networks, media, or Internet of Things (IoT). 
// As MongoDB doesn’t have a schema, it’s a good choice for dealing with constantly 
// changing and expanding data. 


// This makes MySQL useful when you work with complex transactions, like in ecommerce, 
// transactional, and financial use cases.
// MySQL makes it suitable for data warehousing and online analytical processing

// 6) ORM
// Monogoose ORM is populer

// Sequelize ORM is populer
